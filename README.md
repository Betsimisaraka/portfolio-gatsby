This portfolio is made with gatsby. I got the template from gatsby and then I modified all of the contents including texts and images.

You can see the list of my projects in the home page and a little bit information about me. Projects details page contains the description, screenshots, link to demo and source code.

## Quick Start ðŸš€

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the-plain-gatsby starter
    gatsby new portfolio-gatsby https://github.com/Betsimisaraka/portfolio-gatsby
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd portfolio-gatsby/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
