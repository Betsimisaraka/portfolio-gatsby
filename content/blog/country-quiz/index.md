This app enables the user to learn more about the world's geography in a fun and interactive way.

It contains two different questions kinds (guess the country either by its capital or by its flag) and four answer options out of which the user can choose the answer to the question. I built this app from scratch and I used React to handle the frontend and custom hooks to manage the app's state. The data utilized in the quiz is fetched from the public "Country Data" API.

This project helped me to solidify my knowledge of how custom hooks work in React, as well as learning how approaching a project in a structured manner saves time later on.
