I always love learning new skills whether it is language or coding, as well as getting my hands dirty by applying and acquiring knowledge in a practice-first approach.

I feel comfortable with HTML, CSS/SASS, Vanilla JavaScritp and React. I am willing to implement those skills and excited to enhance them as well. I am from Vavatenina on the East Coast of Madagascar and currently live in Mahanoro where Onja is located. I love being around people and I enjoy collaborating and interacting with others.

If our visions align, I'd love to support your company or project to achieve greater social good!
