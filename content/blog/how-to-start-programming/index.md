I created this CRUD app with ES6 and ES2020. It displays lists of people from an API with their birthday. Also, I can add a new people to the list. I can edit people's information. I can delete a person. They are also sorted by the person how has the nearest birthday.

In this project my goal is to display lists of people by fetching data from an API with people's birth date and their avatar. And calculating their next birthday from the current day. Then I sorted the people by the one who has the nearest birthday.
