I build this project from scratch using sementic HTML5, CSS3 and CSS preprocessor like SASS to create a responsive webpage following BEM notation.

In this project we built a website which shows many kind of photos. This webpage shows how beautiful photos are. And it provide some examples of the photographs that the photographer has taken in the deserts of Morroco. This application is made by `html` and `css/sass`
