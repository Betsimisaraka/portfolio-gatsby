I built this project from scratch using semantic HTML5, CSS3 and CSS preprocessor like SASS to create a responsive webpage following BEM notation.

In this project we built a website which shows many kinds of photos. This webpage shows how beautiful photos are. And it provides some examples of the photographs that the photographer has taken in the deserts of Morocco. This application is made by html and css/sass
