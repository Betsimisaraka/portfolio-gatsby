This a portfolio page which a photographer can use to demonstrate their work.

I built this project from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS and SASS as a CSS preprocessor to create a responsive webpage following BEM notation. It also marked my first go at writing Vanilla JavaScript which I used to get the image slider working smoothly. 

Doing this project empowered my skills in using SCSS, as well as learning how to deal with a complex layout.
