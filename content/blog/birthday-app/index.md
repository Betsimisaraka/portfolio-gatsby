This app will inform the user the upcoming birthday, so that they will never forget whose birthday is coming next.

It allows you to add a new person to the list, update a person's information and delete them. You also can filter people by their name and their month of birth. Entries are sorted by the person who has the nearest birthday.
I created this CRUD app with semantic HTML as a starting point, followed by CSS and JavaScript which is used to generate the page and make it interactive. The data which is displayed on the website is fetched from the "Birthday people JSON" API. The data is also stored in local storage. 

Completing this project enhanced my working knowledge of additive filtering and dealing with complex date formats by using the "date-fns" library. I am also proud of the way in which I used to overcome all of the problems that I encountered with this project, which led to an amazing birthday app page.
