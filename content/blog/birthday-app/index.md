I created this CRUD app with ES6 and ES2020. It displays lists of people from an API with their birthday. Also, I can add new people to the list. I can edit people's information. I can delete a person. They are also sorted by the person who has the nearest birthday.

This app will remind the user when the next birthday is.They can add a person whoever they want to be in the list.
